This app will just create a button that punches in the Fi US Cellular dialer code for you so you don't have to remember the disgusting looking code.

That's it. It will be a button. And all it will do is switch to US Cellular (why would you want to use sprint?)

Yeah other apps can do this for you+more, but I'm a cheapass and I don't want to pay $1 when I can make a crappier version myself.
